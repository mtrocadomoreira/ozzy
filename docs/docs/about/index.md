# About

Ozzy was initially developed by [Mariana Moreira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariana-t-moreira/) as a way to cope with her feeling of overwhelm when trying to process data from different simulation codes and designing complex analysis scripts for multidimensional data. Less of our time as physicists should be spent figuring out how to parse data into a convenient format and debugging the array manipulation bits of our code.

This project can be extended to any simulation file format, and the hope is that it can prove useful to other plasma physicists.
